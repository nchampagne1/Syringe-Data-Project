# Syringe-Data-Project
Syringe litter is a concern for all New Yorkers. The city is working to clean up syringe litter and to educate community members about how to get rid of syringes safely and prevent needlestick injury. Data gathered from NYC Open Data in creating this report, that aims to give a detailed overview on that data gathered from 2017-2023.
# Data Visualization: Bar Chart
I chose a bar chart to depict the relationship between the amount of syringes found around New York to the months in the year to determine if there was a pattrn to be seen. From my chart, the relationship between the syringes found and the months of the year show that there is a significant increase in the average amount found as soon as it reaches the summer months and that amount slower decreases in the winter
