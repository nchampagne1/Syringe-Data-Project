# Syringe-Data-Project
Syringe litter is a concern for all New Yorkers. The city is working to clean up syringe litter and to educate community members about how to get rid of syringes safely and prevent needlestick injury. Data gathered from NYC Open Data in creating this report, that aims to give a detailed overview on that data gathered from 2017-2023.

# Data Visualization: Bar Chart
I chose a bar chart to depict the relationship between the amount of syringes found around New York to the months in the year to determine if there was a pattrn to be seen. From my chart, the relationship between the syringes found and the months of the year show that there is a significant increase in the average amount found as soon as it reaches the summer months and that amount slower decreases in the winter

# Data Visualization: Box Plot
I chose a box plot to showcase the median numbers of syringes found in two parks, Tompkins Square Park and Coleman Playground, in Manhattan. A box plot allowed me to compare the median of syringe collections in different parks. You can easily see which parks tend to have higher or lower median numbers of syringes collected.

# Regression Analysis
Multiple Linear Regression Model with columns 'Source' and the 'Year' number to predict the "Group" value which holds the names of the groups responsible for the collection of syringes. For multiple linear regression, R-squared is calculated as the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. My R-Squared value amounted to 0.73, which indicates that the independent variables explain most of the variability of the dependent variable.
The correlation coefficient (r) is typically used to describe the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable individually. My value was 0.39 or 0.4 which indicates that there was little linear relationship.

# Conclusion
Using Data Science and Regression Analysis is an important skill in understanding, manipulating and presenting data in an organized way that provides insight on various trends. From this analysis I was able to better understand the dataset I chose and find significance in the numbers. 
In conclusion, this scientific report provides valuable insights into syringe surveillance in NYC and serves as a foundation for informed decision-making and policy development aimed at addressing syringe litter and ensuring the well-being of NYC residents.
